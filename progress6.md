The last five are fixed using the feedback given in progress4.md, now they can pass the validator.

For 0001ST18.yaml, KangKSLPSKCCHY18.yaml, PulteFDFSS18.yaml, I tried the approach you suggested, it still has the same error. I think we might declare using a different base image as "necessary". 

# A response

repos/yuxuanm4/ChenYZZJZ24.yaml states that `execute_process` failed to execute a command. What command? Why did that command fail (this is what is meant by "distal cause")?. Any previous output regarding the command above that point may help. What workarounds did you try?
